## What is a Order-Item?
When a customer places a customized product order through your store and completes payment, the order is automatically synced with MockSpark. Once we receive the order details, we break it down by product into smaller sub-orders, which we refer to as **Order-Items**.

<Tip>**The relationship between orders and order items**: From a customer perspective, an order is a list of selected products. For example, an order might contain two cups and a hat. Each product on that list is an order item. From a store perspective, an order is a list of order items. It is part of the store's data.</Tip>

Breaking down a single order into multiple **Order-Items** offers several key benefits:
1. A single order may include both customizable products fulfilled by MockSpark and other unrelated products sold in your store. Since we don’t handle those unrelated items, automatically filtering them out helps simplify order management and reduce confusion for you.
2. If a customer places one order for a T-shirt and later places another order for a hat, and both items are fulfilled through the same platform (such as Printify), we can now consolidate these Order Items based on the shipping address before sending them to the fulfillment provider. This significantly reduces shipping costs by avoiding duplicate shipment fees for items going to the same customer.
3. If an order contains an item that is out of stock or has another issue, we can easily move forward with fulfilling the available items without requiring you to manually split the order. This helps ensure faster fulfillment and reduces the risk of losing the entire order.

Go to the **Order Items** section from the top navigation bar.

## Search
The search area in the **Order Items** section supports the following six filter options:
1. `Shopify Order Name`: Unique identifier for the order that appears on the Shopify order. For example, #1000 or _Store1001.
2. `Order Create At`: The date and time when the Order-Item was created. You can filter by a date range, with support for searching up to the most recent 90 days
3. `Product Title`: The product title with the Order-Item. Supports partial keyword search.
4. `Customer Email`: The customer's email address associated with the Order-Item.
5. `Fulfillment Platform`: The fulfillment platform responsible for processing the product in the Order-Item.
6. `Status`: The status of the Order-Item. To learn more, see our [Status of Order-Item Explained](/chinese/order-items/order-items#status-of-order-item-explained)

You can apply multiple filters at once to refine your search. Click the **Search** button to view Order-Items that match your selected criteria.
