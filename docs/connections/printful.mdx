Once you've completed a quick setup, you’ll be able to create and publish **Printful** products directly from our platform. You can also sync orders to **Printful** for automatic production and fulfillment. This helps reduce manual work, so you can focus your time and energy on growing your business.

In the following steps, we’ll walk you through the **Printful** integration process to help you launch your print-on-demand business quickly and easily.

## Generate a New Token

Go to [Printful Developers](https://developers.printful.com/login) and select **Sign in to Printful**.

On the `Add new token` page, fill out the following fields:

1. In the `Token name` field, enter a **Name** that helps you quickly identify the purpose of the token, such as `"MockSpark"`.
2. In the `Contact email` field, enter your primary **Email** address.
3. In the `Expiration date` field, set how long the **Token** should remain active. Once the token expires, it will no longer be usable. We recommend choosing the longest duration available (Printful supports a maximum of 2 years).

Next, follow these steps:

1. In the `Access level` field, switch to the **A single store** option, then select the **Printful Store** you want to connect to MockSpark from the dropdown menu.
2. In the `Scopes` section, check **all** available permissions.
3. Click **Create new token** to complete the process.

Once the token is created, scroll down to the `Access key` section at the bottom of the page. You will see your newly generated token there. Copy the **Token** to your clipboard.

<Warning>The Token from Printful is only shown once at the time it is created, so make sure to store it securely.</Warning>

2. Click the **Test this API Token** button to make sure the token is correctly formatted and working properly.
3. After confirming that the API token is set up correctly, go to the **Store** field and select the Printful store you want to connect.
