Once you've completed a quick setup, you’ll be able to create and publish **Printify** products directly from our platform. You can also sync orders to **Printify** for automatic production and fulfillment. This helps reduce manual work, so you can focus your time and energy on growing your business.

In the following steps, we’ll walk you through the **Printify** integration process to help you launch your print-on-demand business quickly and easily.

## Generate a New Token

If you want to align the shipping methods used in your Shopify store with those available through Printify, you can enable the option under **Send Shipping Method to Fulfill**. Then, use the **Shipping Method Match** section to map the shipping options from your store to the corresponding fulfillment methods on Printify.

<Tip>The **Send Shipping Method to Fulfill** setting is optional.</Tip>

Enabling the **Send Shipping Method to Fulfill** option can help reduce your operating costs. However, it's important to be familiar with the pros and cons of different shipping methods before using this setting. If you're not sure about the differences, it's perfectly fine to leave this option turned off for now.

1. Once everything is set up, click **Save** to complete the connection to your Printify store.

<Tip>If a printify store is set as the default, all bulk fulfillment order-items will be processed through that store.</Tip>
