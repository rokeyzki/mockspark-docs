## Why Can't Suppliers Fulfill Orders Using Our Production Files?
Our production files are designed for products that use standard printing methods, such as Direct to Garment (DTG), All Over Printing (AOP), and sublimation printing. At this time, we do not support production methods that require specialized techniques or materials, such as embroidery, screen printing, or engraving.

Here’s a brief overview of the three printing methods we support:

#### 1. DTG Printing
Direct-to-Garment (DTG) Printing is a digital printing technology that allows images to be printed directly onto clothing or other textiles. Using equipment similar to an inkjet printer, DTG applies water-based inks directly onto the fabric, which are then cured using heat or infrared dryers to bond the ink to the material.

DTG printing offers several advantages over traditional screen printing, including:
* High-resolution, detailed, and vibrant designs with a wide range of colors
* Cost-effective for small print runs since there are no setup costs or expensive printing plates
* Faster turnaround times thanks to a fully digital production process
* Reduced waste and lower environmental impact as fewer materials and chemicals are required

Overall, DTG printing is an efficient, versatile, and eco-friendly method ideal for producing high-quality custom apparel and textile products.

#### 2. AOP
All-Over Print (AOP) is a printing technique that covers the entire surface of a fabric with vibrant, seamless, high-resolution designs. This method allows for eye-catching, full-coverage prints and is widely used in apparel, home textiles, and sportswear. In North America, all-over printing has become increasingly popular, with many producers relying on this technology to create premium, customized clothing and textile products.

Compared to Direct-to-Garment (DTG) printing, AOP has the following differences:
* Print coverage: DTG applies designs to specific areas of a garment or textile, while AOP prints cover the entire piece of fabric from edge to edge.
* Printing process: DTG uses inkjet technology to print directly onto finished garments, whereas AOP applies the design to large rolls of fabric, which are then cut and sewn into finished products.
* Production workflow: DTG is ideal for simple, on-demand, small-batch orders thanks to its straightforward process. In contrast, AOP involves more complex steps, such as printing, cutting, and sewing, making it well-suited for larger production runs and highly customized products.

In summary, DTG and AOP each have their own strengths and are best suited for different types of products and production needs. DTG is great for small runs and localized designs, while AOP is the go-to method for creating bold, all-over prints and meeting higher volume requirements.

#### 3. Sublimation Printing
Sublimation Printing is a digital printing process that transfers full-color images onto textiles or other materials using heat and pressure. The design is first printed onto a special coated paper, then transferred onto the final product using high temperature and pressure. Sublimation printing is widely used for custom apparel, home textiles, accessories, and gifts. Many manufacturers rely on this technique to create high-quality, personalized products such as t-shirts, towels, mugs, and mousepads. Sublimation printing stands out for producing vibrant colors, sharp patterns, and long-lasting results on a variety of materials, making it a popular choice for custom products with strong visual impact.

Here’s how sublimation printing differs from Direct-to-Garment (DTG) printing:
* Printing method: Sublimation uses heat and pressure to transfer ink from paper onto polyester or coated materials. In DTG printing, ink is sprayed directly onto the surface of the fabric.
* Print quality: Sublimation delivers bright, vivid colors that are durable and resistant to fading, because the ink actually becomes part of the material. DTG excels at highly detailed and realistic prints, offering greater resolution and color gradation.
* Material compatibility: Sublimation works best on polyester-based fabrics and specially coated surfaces. DTG is suitable for a wide range of natural and synthetic fibers, such as cotton, linen, silk, wool, and polyester blends.
* Production process: Sublimation requires an extra step to first print the image onto paper before it is transferred to the product, making the process more complex. DTG allows you to print designs directly onto products, which is ideal for smaller orders and quick turnaround times.

Overall, sublimation is ideal for vibrant, large-format designs and applications on specialty materials, while DTG is preferred when you need intricate, detailed graphics with a broad range of colors, especially on garments made from natural fibers.

## Why Is There a Color Difference in Print Results?
We are committed to helping merchants achieve the best possible print quality. However, due to differences between the color modes used on screens and in print production, the final printed product may not exactly match what you see on your monitor. This slight variation is a normal part of the printing process.

Monitors use the RGB color mode, while our production partners print using the CMYK color mode.

For example, monitors can display bright, vivid colors—including special and fluorescent tones—more clearly, especially in lighter shades. When an RGB design is converted to CMYK for printing, certain colors may appear more muted or less vibrant. In addition, factors like the type of paper, printing environment, and placement on the print template can introduce a color difference of about 10 to 15 percent. Some colors shown on a screen simply cannot be reproduced in print and will be replaced by the closest available alternative, which may result in the final colors looking a bit duller or less natural. Think of it like trying to mix regular watercolor paints to create fluorescent green or pink—it just isn’t possible.

To minimize noticeable color differences, we recommend avoiding colors that are difficult to reproduce accurately, such as blue-violet or brown. When designing with gray, use only black ink rather than a mix of three colors. Also, avoid using overly bright or neon colors, as they may require more ink and lead to greater color variation in the finished product.

## Why Do Designs with Transparency Look Blotchy After Printing?

Transparency as a design element can look great on certain products and with AOP, but on DTG printing, it’s tricky. If you don’t fully understand how it behaves, your final print project could look patchy or unintentional.

**DTG and transparency don’t always mix**.

Whether your semi-transparent artwork prints well on a t-shirt depends on:
* **How you created the design** – Effects like feather brushes or low-opacity layers are technically semi-transparent.
* **The level of transparency** – Fully transparent elements (100%) will disappear, but anything in between might not behave as expected.

Garment color and white underbase behavior:
* **White garments** – No white underbase, transparency will print as-is.
* **Light garments** – The underbase might peek through just a little.
* **Dark garments** – The underbase may appear as small white speckles in semi-transparent areas.

**Tip**: Always check your transparency in the Design Maker preview before ordering a test print. This will prevent surprises.

**Transparency and AOP or sublimation? No problem**

For all-over print (AOP) and sublimation products (like leggings, mugs, or towels), transparency is fine. These printing methods don’t use a white underbase, so your design will appear exactly as it looks in your final document.

Still, it’s best to fill the entire bleed area to avoid white borders or blank fabric showing through, unless you’re intentionally designing around those.

**Important note on phone cases**: Keep your design elements at either **0%** or **100% transparency**. We don’t recommend using semi-transparent areas, as they often result in **patchy or uneven printing**.
