## Introducing Team Management

Our Team Management feature is designed to help you organize your teams more efficiently and collaborate with ease. With this tool, you can define custom roles, assign the right permissions, and add team members with specific responsibilities, creating a permission structure that fits your organization’s needs.

This feature allows you to:
* Clearly define roles and responsibilities to boost collaboration.
* Control access levels to protect sensitive information.
* Monitor and adjust your team structure as your business grows.

In the following steps, we’ll walk you through how to create roles, add team members, and make the most of Team Management to streamline your daily operations.

## Create a New Role

1. Select **Team** section from the top navigation bar.
2. In the dropdown menu, click on **Roles**.

The **Store owner** refers to the Shopify admin account for a given store. Our system automatically creates a role called `Owner` for this account. This role has full permissions by default and cannot be edited or deleted.

Click **New Role** button to create a new role.

1. Enter a name for the new role in the **Role name** field.
2. Select the **Permissions** you want to assign by checking boxes within the six permission sets.
    <Warning>Each permission set includes two access levels: `View` and `Manage`. The `View` permission allows users to see the data, while the `Manage` permission grants the ability to edit it.</Warning>
    * The **Account** permission set includes the most essential permissions for any role. In most cases, this should be selected for all roles; without it, users may not be able to perform basic account-related actions.
    * The **Connections** permission set determines whether a user can view and manage features within the `Connections Section`.
    * The **Products** permission set controls whether a user can access and manage features within the `Products Section`, such as creating new products and publishing them to your store.
    * The **Order Items** permission set determines whether a user can view and manage features within the `Order Items Section`, such as reviewing and fulfilling order items.
    * The **Billing** permission set controls whether a user can access and manage features within the `Billing Section`, such as viewing usage and purchase data, upgrading the subscription plan.
    * The **Marketing** permission set determines whether a user can view and manage features within the `Marketing Section`, such as accessing and editing resource collections like pictures and other media.
3. Click **Save** to create the role.
