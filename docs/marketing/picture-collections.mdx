## What is a Picture Collection?

A **Picture Collection** is a set of themed images that you create or carefully select to provide design options for your products. These collections are showcased in your store’s dedicated `Product Personalizer`, where your customers can use them to create their own customized designs. By offering these picture collections, you make it easier for shoppers to personalize their purchases, which can help increase customer engagement and boost sales.

<Warning>Please make sure your uploaded images do not contain any copyrighted material, explicit content, or violent imagery. To keep our platform safe and respectful for everyone, we may remove content that violates these guidelines. Thank you for helping us maintain a positive experience for all users.</Warning>

In general, **Picture Collections** can include your brand’s logos, promotional graphics, or themed assets for occasions like Mother’s Day, Christmas, and more.

In the **Picture Collections** table, you’ll see a new row has been added. This is the collection you just created. Since the `Quantity` column shows that no images have been added yet, you’ll need to click **Upload** in the `Action` column to start uploading pictures to this collection.
