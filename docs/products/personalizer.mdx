<Tip>In this tutorial, **Product Personalizer** will be referred to as **Personalizer**.</Tip>

## Use on Desktop Devices

At the top right of the **Personalizer**, you can view and switch between all available product options, such as color, size, and more.

</Frame>

On the right side of the **Personalizer**, you can view and switch between the Print-Areas currently being customized. A product may include one or several Print-Areas, such as the front and back of a polo shirt. To learn more about Print-Areas, please visit [Products tutorial](/docs/products/products#print-areas).

</Frame>

On the left side of the **Personalizer**, you’ll find the tools for adding design elements to the canvas.

There are several ways to add design elements. First is the **Pictures** section, which offers a collection of images provided by the merchant. To learn more about the `Pictures` feature, please visit [Picture Collections tutorial](/docs/marketing/picture-collections).

1. Select **Pictures** as your method for adding design element.
2. In the **Pictures** panel that appears to the right of the button, choose your preferred image and add it to the canvas to begin designing.

</Frame>

The second way to add design elements is by using the **Visuals** section, where you can place a variety of fun vector graphics (such as stickers, emojis, and more) onto your design canvas.

 **Visuals** are design assets provided by the MockSpark platform. These assets are typically vector images, which means they can be scaled without losing quality. This makes them ideal for different printing needs and helps prevent issues like blurry or low-quality prints.

<Warning>Because of how Visuals work, each Print-Area can contain up to three Visuals at a time.</Warning>

1. Select **Visuals** as your method for adding design element.
2. In the **Visuals** panel that appears to the right of the button, browse and select your preferred visual to add it to the canvas.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/products/personalizer/PixPin_2025-05-28_16-09-47.png" />
</Frame>

In addition to the two methods mentioned earlier, you can also add text to your design canvas through the **Text** feature. We offer a variety of fonts for you to choose from.

1. Select **Text** as your method for adding design element.
2. In the **Text** panel that appears to the right of the button, choose your preferred font and add it to the canvas to begin designing.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/products/personalizer/PixPin_2025-05-28_16-11-02.png" />
</Frame>

If the previous methods for adding design elements don't suit your needs, you can use the **Uploads** feature to add your own images to the design canvas. This could be photos you've taken yourself or images generated by other AI tools.

<Warning>We support images in JPG, PNG, and WebP formats.</Warning>

1. Select **Uploads** as your method for adding design element.
2. In the **Uploads** panel that appears to the right of the button, you can upload images by taking or selecting them from your current device. You can also upload images by scanning a QR code with your phone.
<Frame>

At the center of the **Personalizer** is our design area, also known as the `canvas`. When you select a `text design element` on the canvas, a control bar for that text automatically appears above it. This control bar allows you to customize various properties of the text, such as color, font, and size.

<Tip>Double-clicking the text on the canvas lets you edit its content.</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/products/personalizer/PixPin_2025-05-28_16-25-00.png" />
</Frame>

When you select an `image design element` on the canvas (excluding Visuals), a control bar automatically appears above it. This bar allows you to crop, flip, rotate, and perform other edits on the image.

<Warning>Below the canvas, you'll see an estimate of the image's print quality. If you receive a **Low resolution** warning during the design process, it means you need to adjust your design to ensure better print quality.</Warning>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/products/personalizer/PixPin_2025-05-28_16-26-24.png" />
</Frame>

When you select a `visual design element` on the canvas, such as a sticker or emoji, a control bar automatically appears above it. This bar allows you to flip, rotate, and make other adjustments to the visual.

<Info>Visual design elements do not show print quality warnings like image elements might.</Info>

When you right-click on a design element, you can duplicate or delete it. You also have the option to adjust its layer order within the current design or align it on the canvas.
<Frame>

</Frame>

In addition to manipulating individual design elements on the canvas, you can use the canvas control bar below the **Personalizer** to manage the entire canvas of the current Print-Area.

1. Select **Layer** from the canvas control bar at the bottom of the **Personalizer**.
2. In the **Layer** panel that appears, you can view, remove, and manually rearrange the order of the design elements by dragging them.

</Frame>

At the bottom left of the **Personalizer** is the preview window that displays the current design effect. When you move your mouse over this window, buttons for switching between preview images will appear.

<Tip>The design preview images in the Personalizer are essentially product mockups created by the merchant. If the merchant has made only one mockup for this particular product specification, there will be just one preview image available here.</Tip>

Once you've finished your design, click the **Add to cart** button at the top right corner of the **Personalizer**. A dialog box will appear, allowing you to enter the `quantity` of the customized product you wish to purchase.

Additionally, if there are any issues such as `undesigned` Print-Areas or images with `poor print quality`, the dialog box will alert you. It's recommended that you make adjustments to your design based on these alerts to ensure better print results.
