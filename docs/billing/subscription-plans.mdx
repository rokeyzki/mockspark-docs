A subscription plan is how MockSpark charges for its services, allowing Shopify merchants to pay a recurring fee to access the platform and take advantage of its features.

<Tip>Our subscription plans are powered by the Shopify platform, making them easy and reliable for all Shopify merchants to use with confidence.</Tip>

The subscription pricing model is a combination of time and usage-based subscriptions.

## How It Works
Each Shopify store can have only one active subscription to the MockSpark App. Merchants must approve the subscription, and any recurring charges are billed automatically.

If a merchant changes their subscription while their current plan is active, then they need to accept a new recurring app charge. The existing subscription is canceled and replaced by the new subscription after the merchant approves it. Charges and credits can be prorated, and charges can be deferred, when merchants move to a new plan depending on the subscription change.

When MockSpark App is uninstalled, Shopify automatically cancels the subscription. A credit isn't applied to cover the cost of the rest of the billing period. Merchants can reinstall and use the MockSpark App for the remainder of the billing period.

When a store's billing account freezes, associated MockSpark App subscriptions also freeze.

## Cancel Your Subscription Plan
Since MockSparkâ€™s subscription fees are managed through Shopify Billing, your subscription will be automatically canceled when you uninstall the MockSpark App from your Shopify admin.

When you cancel your subscription, all of your product data in MockSpark will remain unchanged. If you decide to use MockSpark again, simply reinstall the app and your data will still be there.

## How Third-Party Fulfillment Charges Work
Please note that for products fulfilled through third-party providers such as Printify and Printful, all production and shipping services are handled directly by those fulfillment platforms.

Our app facilitates product customization and order transfer, but it does not include third-party production or delivery fees in your Mockspark subscription. Any costs related to manufacturing, shipping, or additional services from Printify or Printful will be charged through your connected accounts on those respective platforms.
