If you go over the limits of your current subscription plan, you have two options: upgrade your plan or add credits to your app balance.

<Tip>**Prerequisites** : Before you begin, make sure to see [Subscription Plans Guide](/docs/billing/subscription-plans).</Tip>

Credits can be used to pay for services within MockSpark, but you'll need to have an active subscription to apply them.

All credit purchases are still processed through Shopify Billing.
